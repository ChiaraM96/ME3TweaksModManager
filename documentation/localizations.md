# Localization "mods"

ME3Tweaks Mod Manager, starting with Build 108/Version 6.1, support installation of localization "mods". The term mods here is in quotes as it is not really a mod, it's more of an addition to an existing mod. 
An example of this would be the Italian translation of Ark Mod, which doesn't ship with the ITA localization files. A third party developed this localization, and with permission, distributed this as a separate download on NexusMods. This file could be installed with the LOCALIZATION task header in Mod Manager.
